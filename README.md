More features will probably be added in the future. Do you have an idea for a new feature? [PRs are very welcome](https://github.com/corneliusludmann/gitpod-trivia-extension)!

**Want to see it in action?** [Click here to open a Gitpod workspace with this extension pre-installed.](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/corneliusludmann/gitpod-trivia-extension)

_**Note:** This extension works in Gitpod only (it needs the `gp` command)._
